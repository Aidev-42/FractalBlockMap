FractalBlockMap
Introduction
FractalBlockMap is a platform allowing users to claim and own unique blocks on the Fractal Bitcoin blockchain. Each block represents a digital space that can be mapped and used for future developments. FractalBlockMap introduces a decentralized concept of digital property.

How It Works
Users can claim blocks of the Fractal Bitcoin blockchain using a script that interacts with the node via RPC calls. Once a block is claimed, the user’s Fractal Bitcoin address is associated with that block, creating a digital map of ownership.

Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Create a Fractal Bitcoin Wallet
Download and set up a wallet compatible with Fractal Bitcoin.
Generate a public address to claim blocks.
Step 2: Claim a Block
Run the Python script provided to claim a block.
Choose the block to claim and enter your Fractal Bitcoin address.
The script will register the claim and associate the block with the user’s Bitcoin address.
Step 3: Verify Ownership
After claiming the block, use the same script to verify ownership and view the details of the claimed block.
Technical Details
FractalBlockMap relies on RPC calls to communicate with the Fractal Bitcoin node. Users interact with the blockchain using a Python script that allows them to claim blocks, record ownership information, and view block details. Data is managed through secure connections to the Fractal node.

Roadmap and Updates
Phase 1: Enable block claims via Python script and RPC connections.
Phase 2: Implement block tokenization for exchanges and user interactions.
Phase 3: Add advanced features like an interactive block map, digital spaces, and property exchanges between users.
With FractalBlockMap, we are transforming the way users interact with the Fractal Bitcoin blockchain, creating a unique and decentralized digital property ecosystem
